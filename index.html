					<p><img src="images/gitlogo.png" width="512" height="512" alt="Two nodes coming off a   
					main branch" title="Git Logo" class="left">So, what is Git in a nutshell? This is an
					important section to absorb, because if you understand what Git is and the fundamentals  
					of how it works, then using Git effectively will probably be much easier for you. As you
					learn Git, try to clear your mind of the things you may know about other VCSs, such as 
					CVS, Subversion or Perforce — doing so will help you avoid subtle confusion when using 
					the tool. Even though Git's user interface is fairly similar to these other VCSs, Git 
					stores and thinks about information in a very different way, and understanding these 
					differences will help you avoid becoming confused while using it.</p>
					<h2>Snapshots, Not Differences</h2>
					<p>The major difference between Git and any other VCS (Subversion and friends included) 
					is the way Git thinks about its data. Conceptually, most other systems store information 
					as a list of file-based changes. These other systems (CVS, Subversion, Perforce, and so 
					on) think of the information they store as a set of files and the changes made to each 
					file over time (this is commonly described as delta-based version control).</p>

    					<h2>Overview of GitHub</h2>
    					<p><img src="images/githublogo.png" width="1027" height="1027" alt="Silhouette of a cat's head" 
					title="GitHub Logo" class="left">GitHub is a web-based interface that uses Git, the open source 
					version control software that lets multiple people make separate changes to web pages at the 
					same time. As Carpenter notes, because it allows for real-time collaboration, GitHub encourages 
					teams to work together to build and edit their site content. GitHub allows multiple developers 
					to work on a single project at the same time, reduces the risk of duplicative or conflicting work, 
					and can help decrease production time. With GitHub, developers can build code, track changes, and 
					innovate solutions to problems that might arise during the site development process simultaneously. 
					Non-developers can also use it to create, edit, and update website content, which Carpenter 
					demonstrates in her tutorial.</p>
   					 <h3>What Else About GitHub?</h3>
    					<p>When starting a project using issues and project boards, write your content on external word 
					processors or via Google Docs, and then, save these files to their respective project boards.
					These steps allow developers and content creators to have a master copy of the file(s), thus 
					elping them track changes over the course of a project. In addition, developers should consider 
					downloading GitHub Desktop. GitHub Desktop allows users to do everything that could be done on 
					GitHub’s web interface, but locally on a user’s machine. GitHub is built to be a collaborative 
					interface. By allowing multiple users to work on the same project simultaneously and requiring 
					cross-team approval for pull requests, GitHub not only allows for, but encourages collaboration 
					within design teams. This type of collaboration can help produce a higher level of quality 
					control.</p>

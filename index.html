					<p><img src="images/gitlogo.png" width="406" height="406" alt="Two nodes coming off a   
					main branch" title="Git Logo" class="right">So, what is Git in a nutshell? This is an
					important section to absorb, because if you understand what Git is and the fundamentals  
					of how it works, then using Git effectively will probably be much easier for you. As you
					learn Git, try to clear your mind of the things you may know about other VCSs, such as 
					CVS, Subversion or Perforce — doing so will help you avoid subtle confusion when using 
					the tool. Even though Git's user interface is fairly similar to these other VCSs, Git 
					stores and thinks about information in a very different way, and understanding these 
					differences will help you avoid becoming confused while using it.</p>
					<h2>Snapshots, Not Differences</h2>
					<p>The major difference between Git and any other VCS (Subversion and friends included) 
					is the way Git thinks about its data. Conceptually, most other systems store information 
					as a list of file-based changes. These other systems (CVS, Subversion, Perforce, and so 
					on) think of the information they store as a set of files and the changes made to each 
					file over time (this is commonly described as delta-based version control).</p>

    					<h2>Overview of GitHub</h2>
    					<p><img src="images/githublogo.png" width="1027" height="1027" alt="Silhouette of a cat's head" 
					title="GitHub Logo" class="left">GitHub is a web-based interface that uses Git, the open source 
					version control software that lets multiple people make separate changes to web pages at the 
					same time. As Carpenter notes, because it allows for real-time collaboration, GitHub encourages 
					teams to work together to build and edit their site content. GitHub allows multiple developers 
					to work on a single project at the same time, reduces the risk of duplicative or conflicting work, 
					and can help decrease production time. With GitHub, developers can build code, track changes, and 
					innovate solutions to problems that might arise during the site development process simultaneously. 
					Non-developers can also use it to create, edit, and update website content, which Carpenter 
					demonstrates in her tutorial.</p>
   					 <h3>What Else About GitHub?</h3>
    					<p>When starting a project using issues and project boards, write your content on external word 
					processors or via Google Docs, and then, save these files to their respective project boards.
					These steps allow developers and content creators to have a master copy of the file(s), thus 
					elping them track changes over the course of a project. In addition, developers should consider 
					downloading GitHub Desktop. GitHub Desktop allows users to do everything that could be done on 
					GitHub’s web interface, but locally on a user’s machine. GitHub is built to be a collaborative 
					interface. By allowing multiple users to work on the same project simultaneously and requiring 
					cross-team approval for pull requests, GitHub not only allows for, but encourages collaboration 
					within design teams. This type of collaboration can help produce a higher level of quality 
					control.</p>

					<h2>Overview of  SourceTree?</h2>
					<p><img src="images/sourcetree.png" width="400" height="504" class="right" alt="A keyhole" title="SourceTree 
					logo">Sourcetree is a free graphical user interface (GUI) desktop client that simplifies how you interact with 
					Git repositories so that you can fully concentrate on coding. Say goodbye to the command line — this GUI makes 
					it easy to visualize and manage your repositories. It also integrates with Mercurial to ensure an efficient, 
					consistent development process. Visualize your work and execute push commands with a whole new level of 
					confidence. Even changing or discarding a file, a hunk, or an entire line is now simple!</p>
					<p>SourceTree was first released in 2011 by Atlassian, the same company behind popular developer tools like 
					Jira and Bitbucket. Designed to simplify the use of Git through a graphical interface, SourceTree quickly 
					gained traction and became a go-to Git GUI for both Git and Mercurial version control systems. It has seen 
					regular updates over the years, keeping it relevant and well-maintained. SourceTree is best suited for 
					individual developers and smaller teams who are looking for a free, user-friendly Git GUI that still offers 
					a comprehensive set of features. It's especially beneficial for those already embedded in the Atlassian 
					ecosystem, as it offers seamless integration with tools like Bitbucket and Jira.</p>

					<h2>Overview of  Git GUI/h2>
					<p><img src="images/gitgui.png" width="92" height="177" class="left" alt="Git as text in a vertical
					orientation" title="Git GUI logo">A "Git GUI" stands for "Git Graphical User Interface,"which is a 
					program that allows users to interact with the Git version control system through a visual interface
					instead of using command-line commands, making it easier for people who prefer a graphical way to
					manage their code changes, commits, branches, and other Git operations. </p>
					<p>Git comes with four components. Git CMD is just like regular Windows command prompt with the git 
					command. It lets you use all of Git features through command line. Useful if you are already 
					familiar with Windows cmd and you only work on Windows. Git Bash emulates a bash environment on 
					windows. It lets you use all git features in command line plus most of standard unix commands. Useful 
					if you are used to Linux and want to keep the same habits. Git GUI is a Graphical User Interface 
					letting you use Git without touching command line. It is an alternative among other Git clients. 
					Since Git GUI is very minimal, you could also look at other alternatives if GUIs interest you. It 
					is up to you to decide which you want to use. As many others, I recommend you to learn Git with 
					command line before switching to a graphical interface. If you don't know which to choose between 
					Git Bash and Git CMD, I'd go for Git Bash since bash is a really useful tool to learn.</p>
